Welcome to my personal website. [cite_start]I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London [cite: 2, 9][cite_start], where I specialize in the application of Artificial Intelligence to complex biomedical challenges[cite: 3].

[cite_start]My doctoral research is focused on developing next-generation **Digital Twins for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**[cite: 13, 15]. [cite_start]As part of a cross-disciplinary collaboration between the Biosensors Laboratory, Ultrasound Laboratory, and St Mary's Hospital, I am building frameworks that integrate multimodal ICU data, physiological modeling, and AI-driven clinical decision support[cite: 17]. [cite_start]The ultimate goal is to create patient-specific models that can simulate patient trajectories and guide therapy optimization in neurocritical care[cite: 20, 21].

My research interests cover several key areas of AI and bioengineering:

* [cite_start]**Stable & Generalizable Predictive Modeling:** Developing robust feature-selection algorithms and knowledge-transfer frameworks to ensure models are valid and reproducible across different hospitals[cite: 23, 24].
* [cite_start]**Long-Sequence Generative Modeling:** Using parallel diffusion models to impute and generate clinically plausible medical time-series data over long horizons (days to weeks)[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**Reinforcement Learning for Therapy:** Building systems that simulate and rank treatment strategies, assisting clinicians in selecting optimal interventions while retaining human oversight[cite: 29].
* [cite_start]**Translational Imaging:** Pioneering non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) estimation by integrating ultrasound with microbubble contrast imaging[cite: 31].

[cite_start]Beyond my PhD, I am also a **Principal Scientist and Co-Founder of translational AI ventures**[cite: 43], where I lead the translation of research into deployable healthcare technologies. [cite_start]This work has included developing AI for chronic disease management using gut microbiome "fingerprints" [cite: 45][cite_start], designing smart wearables for elderly health monitoring [cite: 48][cite_start], and co-developing Evo-Micro, a genomic foundation model for synthetic microbiome therapeutics[cite: 50, 51].

This website serves as a living archive of my work. Please feel free to explore my list of [Publications](/publications/), review my [Teaching Experience](/teaching/), or browse my full [CV](/cv/).
