Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London, where I specialize in the application of Artificial Intelligence to complex biomedical challenges.

My doctoral research is focused on developing next-generation **Digital Twins for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**. As part of a cross-disciplinary collaboration between the Biosensors Laboratory, Ultrasound Laboratory, and St Mary's Hospital, I am building frameworks that integrate multimodal ICU data, physiological modeling, and AI-driven clinical decision support. The ultimate goal is to create patient-specific models that can simulate patient trajectories and guide therapy optimization in neurocritical care.

My research interests cover several key areas of AI and bioengineering:

* **Stable & Generalizable Predictive Modeling:** Developing robust feature-selection algorithms and knowledge-transfer frameworks to ensure models are valid and reproducible across different hospitals.
* **Long-Sequence Generative Modeling:** Using parallel diffusion models to impute and generate clinically plausible medical time-series data over long horizons (days to weeks).
* **Reinforcement Learning for Therapy:** Building systems that simulate and rank treatment strategies, assisting clinicians in selecting optimal interventions while retaining human oversight.
* **Translational Imaging:** Pioneering non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) estimation by integrating ultrasound with microbubble contrast imaging.

Beyond my PhD, I am also a **Principal Scientist and Co-Founder of translational AI ventures**, where I lead the translation of research into deployable healthcare technologies. This work has included developing AI for chronic disease management using gut microbiome "fingerprints", designing smart wearables for elderly health monitoring, and co-developing Evo-Micro, a genomic foundation model for synthetic microbiome therapeutics.
